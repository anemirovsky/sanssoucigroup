      <p>Sans Souci can manage your overflow projects, or step in as a
      part-time COO to improve your whole operation. We’re both efficient and
      flexible, so if you need 5 hours of support one week, and 15 the next,
      that’s fine with us.</p>

    "After launching several successful products, ThingM hired Sans Souci
    to become more efficient and scalable, so they could grow. Previously,
    the company’s co-founders handled almost everything and most of their
    systems were run on spreadsheets. We helped them find and set up systems
    to streamline the flow of their manufacturing, inventory, and sales data.
    We vastly improved their efficiency by implementing web-based
    productivity platforms that can be managed virtually and integrated with
    each other. Once everything was in place, we created cloud-based
    procedural documents for all the new systems so the ThingM team can train
    on-demand and will always know how everything works. Now, Sans Souci
    manages most of ThingM’s day-to-day operations in just a few hours a
    week, meanwhile, ThingM's founders are free to focus on their vision for
    the company, and the parts of the business they most enjoy."</p>

      <p>Everyone needs a way to manage their tasks and projects efficiently, to
      capture and recall crucial information, to maintain positive
      professional relationships, and of course, to keep track of their
      finances. I’ve built Sans Souci to help others manage
      these essential, day-to-day tasks, so they get back to their vision and
      realize their larger goals.</p>

      <p>I've run a profitable business of my own for almost ten years. My years
      of experience working with many different industries has made me
      attentive to the universals of a well run business. I’m deeply
      passionate about the problem solving that goes into making small
      businesses thrive, and enabling the people who create them to achieve
      excellence and fulfillment in their work.</p>
