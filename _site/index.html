      <p>Everyone needs a way to manage their tasks and projects efficiently, to
      capture and recall crucial information, to maintain positive
      professional relationships, and of course, to keep track of their
      finances. I’ve built Sans Souci to help others manage
      these essential, day-to-day tasks, so they get back to their vision and
      realize their larger goals.</p>

      <p>I've run a profitable business of my own for almost ten years. My years
      of experience working with many different industries has made me
      attentive to the universals of a well run business. I’m deeply
      passionate about the problem solving that goes into making small
      businesses thrive, and enabling the people who create them to achieve
      excellence and fulfillment in their work.</p>
